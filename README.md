# Webpack Caman

This is an example project showing how to include CamanJS in a web project.

The npm repository brings in NodeJS dependencies (fibers, fs) which are not required for web target.

Using with webpack requires use of the import-loader to include the caman js files as web targets. 

Easier to work with caman.js files downloaded rather than the npm install in this instance.
